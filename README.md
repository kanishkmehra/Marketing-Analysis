# 📊 Marketing Analytics & Sentiment Analysis Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **data-driven marketing analytics** using SQL, Power BI, and Python. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, track marketing performance, and evaluate product engagement across different platforms.

The repository combines:

* **SQL Queries**: For extracting and cleaning raw marketing and customer data.
* **Power BI Dashboard**: For visualizing key metrics such as conversions, customer engagement, and product performance.
* **Sentiment Analysis (Python/Jupyter Notebook)**: For analyzing customer reviews and feedback using Natural Language Processing (NLP).



## 📈 Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides an overview of:

* **Conversion Rate**: Overall 9.6% with monthly trends and product-level comparison.
* **Social Media Metrics**:

  * Views: ~90M
  * Clicks: ~17.8M (20%)
  * Likes: ~0.41M (5%)
* **Customer Reviews**: Average rating of **3.69** with month-wise and product-wise breakdowns.
* **Product Performance**: Conversion rate and rating analysis across different product categories.


## 🔍 Sentiment Analysis

The **SentimentalAnalysis.ipynb** notebook performs text analytics on customer reviews:

* Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
* Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
* Visualization of sentiment distribution over time.
